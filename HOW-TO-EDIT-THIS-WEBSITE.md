## 1. The 5-minute version

1. Go to the repository on GitHub and press the **period key (`.`)** on your keyboard. This opens the editor in your browser. (Or see Section 2 for other ways.)
2. Find the file you want in the left-hand list and click it.
3. Make your change and save with **Ctrl+S** (Mac: **Cmd+S**).
4. Click the **Source Control** icon on the left (it looks like a branch with dots).
5. Type a short message such as "Add spring workshop event" and click **Commit & Push**.
6. Wait 2-5 minutes. Check the **Actions** tab on GitHub for a green check mark. Your change is now on the website.

> **Important:** Saving a file does NOT publish it. You must **Commit & Push** (step 5).

---

## 2. Editing with GitHub and VS Code in your browser

### What you need
- A free [GitHub](https://github.com) account.
- Permission to edit the repository. Ask the website owner to add you as a collaborator if you don't have it.

### Opening the editor
Pick whichever is easiest:

- **Easiest:** Open the repository on GitHub and press the **`.`** (period) key.
- Or change `github.com` to `github.dev` in the web address.
- Or use this link: <https://github.dev/amaranth-unm/community-geography>

(If the repository has moved, use the address of wherever this repository lives now.)

A screen that looks like a code editor will open. This is "VS Code in the browser."

### Finding your way around

| Area | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Left side, Explorer (two pages icon)** | A list of all the website's files and folders. Click a folder to open it. |
| **Search (magnifying glass)** | Find text across all files. Useful for finding a sentence you want to change. |
| **Source Control (branch icon)** | Where you save and publish your changes. A number badge shows how many files you changed. |
| **Middle** | The file you are editing. |

**Tip:** Press **Ctrl+P** (Mac: **Cmd+P**) and start typing a file name to jump straight to it.

### Making and publishing a change

1. **Open the file** you want to change.
2. **Edit it.** Click in the text and type like you would in a document.
3. **Save** with **Ctrl+S** (Mac: **Cmd+S**).
4. Click the **Source Control** icon on the left.
5. You will see your changed files listed. Click the **+** next to a file to "stage" it (or click **+** next to "Changes" to stage everything).
6. Type a short description in the message box (for example, "Fix typo on mission page").
7. Click **Commit & Push** (or the checkmark, then **Sync Changes**).
8. If it asks which branch, choose the main one (`main`). If you're unsure, stay on `main` for small edits.

### Checking that it worked

1. On the GitHub page for the repository, click the **Actions** tab.
2. Find your most recent entry named **pages build and deployment**.
3. A **yellow circle** means it is still working. A **green check** means it is live. A **red X** means something went wrong (see [Troubleshooting](#11-troubleshooting)).
4. It usually takes 2-5 minutes. Refresh the live website to see the change.

### Made a mistake?

- **Before you commit:** In Source Control, click the small **undo arrow** next to the file to throw away your changes.
- **After you commit:** Nothing is lost. GitHub keeps the full history. Ask a teammate for help, or edit the file again and commit the fix.

### A word about the "front matter"

Many files start with a block between two lines of three dashes:

```
---
title: Community mapping workshop
start_date: '2027-03-12'
---
```

This is "front matter." It is information the website uses (title, dates, pictures). **Edit only the words after the colon.** Do not delete the dashes or the words before the colons. Everything below the second `---` is the normal text of the page.

---

## 3. Where things live

| I want to change... | Go to this folder |
| --- | --- |
| A news story | `_news/` (inside a year folder, like `_news/2026/`) |
| An event | `_events/` (inside a year folder, like `_events/2026/`) |
| A current project | `pages/projects/current-projects/` |
| A past project | `pages/projects/past-projects/` |
| A person on the Team or Affiliates page | `_people/` |
| A word in the Community Geography lexicon | `pages/community-geography/` (files ending in `-lexicon-word.md`) |
| Other pages (About, Funding, Donate, etc.) | `pages/` |
| Pictures | `assets/images/` |
| PDFs and flyers | `assets/documents/` |
| The menu at the top of the site | `_data/nav-top.yml` |
| Site-wide settings (title, email, banner) | `_config.yml` |
| Colors and fonts | `assets/css/themes/unm.css` |
| Text sizes | top of `assets/css/community.css` |

**Folders starting with `_` (underscore) are special.** Leave their names alone.

---

## 4. General edits

### Changing text

Open the page file, find the words, and type. Page text is written in **Markdown**, a simple way to format text:

| You type | You get |
| --- | --- |
| `# Big heading` | A large heading |
| `## Smaller heading` | A medium heading |
| `### Smallest heading` | A small heading |
| `**bold text**` | **bold text** |
| `*italic text*` | *italic text* |
| `- item` (at the start of a line) | A bullet list |
| `1. item` | A numbered list |
| `[link words](https://example.com)` | A clickable link |

Leave a **blank line** between paragraphs, or they will run together.

### Adding a link

```
[Visit the UNM website](https://www.unm.edu)
```

To link to another page on this website, start the address with `{{ site.baseurl }}` and then the page's address:

```
[See our projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/)
[Read about our mission]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/mission)
```

Keep `{{ site.baseurl }}` exactly as shown. It fills in the first part of the website's address. Page addresses have no `.html` on the end; a section's main page ends in `/`.

### Adding an image

**Step 1: Prepare the image.**
- Use a clear file name with lowercase letters, numbers and dashes, and no spaces. Example: `spring-workshop-flyer.jpg`.
- Keep files reasonably small (under about 1 MB if you can). Photos are best as `.jpg`; logos and flyers as `.png`.

**Step 2: Upload it.**
1. In the Explorer, open the right folder under `assets/images/` (for example `assets/images/news/` for news pictures, `assets/images/events/` for event flyers, `assets/images/projects/project/` for project pictures).
2. **Drag and drop** the image from your computer into that folder in the Explorer. (Or right-click the folder and choose **Upload**.)

**Step 3: Show it on the page.** Put this on its own line where you want the picture:

```
![Flyer for the spring workshop]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/news/spring-workshop-flyer.jpg)
```

- The words in the square brackets are the **alt text**: a short description for people who use screen readers. **Always fill it in**, and describe the picture rather than giving its file name.
- Change the path (`/assets/images/news/...`) to match your file.
- To float the picture beside the text, add `{: .img-left}` or `{: .img-right}` right after it. To show it smaller, add a width in pixels: `{: .img-left width="300"}`.

> Some pages (events, news, projects) have special spots for pictures. Those are covered in Sections 5-7. Just give the file's path.

**Step 4:** Commit and push as usual (the uploaded image counts as a change).

The site has an **Optimize Images** tool that shrinks large pictures. On GitHub go to **Actions → Optimize Images → Run workflow**.

### Adding a PDF or document

1. Drag the PDF into `assets/documents/` (use the matching subfolder such as `news` or `funding`).
2. Link to it:

```
[Download the flyer (PDF)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/documents/news/my-flyer.pdf)
```

### Changing colors

All the website's colors are in one file: `assets/css/themes/unm.css`. Near the top you will see lines like:

```
--accent-primary: #007a86;
--interactive-hover: #ba0c2f;
--bg-page: #f8f8f6;
```

The part after the colon (like `#007a86`) is a **color code**. Replace it with another color code and the whole site changes. Find color codes at [htmlcolorcodes.com](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/) (copy the "HEX" value, including the `#`).

| Line starts with | Changes |
| --- | --- |
| `--accent-primary` | Main teal color (buttons, links) |
| `--interactive-hover` | Cherry red (hover and focus color) |
| `--bg-page` | Page background |
| `--bg-nav` | Top menu background |
| `--bg-footer` | Footer background |
| `--text-body` | Main text color |
| `--text-h1`, `--text-h2`, `--text-h3` | Heading colors |

**Tip:** Change one color at a time and check the live site afterward. This stops a typo from breaking many things at once. Keep the `;` at the end of each line.

> The site uses UNM's official brand colors. Check with the Center director before changing them.

### Changing text size or fonts

Fonts are set in the same `unm.css` file under `--font-body` and `--font-heading`. For text size in particular:

- **Page titles, home page section titles, and small text** (labels, buttons, dates) are set by the `--center-size-...` lines at the top of `assets/css/community.css`. Each line controls that size everywhere on the site.
- **Headings inside a page's text** (the `##` and `###` headings) and normal body text are in `assets/css/typography.css`.
- Sizes look like `1.125rem` or `clamp(2.25rem, 4vw, 3.5rem)`. A **bigger number = bigger text**. `1rem` is normal size. In a `clamp(...)`, the first number is the smallest size (phones) and the last is the largest (wide screens).
- Change a number by small steps (for example, `1rem` to `1.1rem`).

Sizes and colors belong in these files, not in a page, so the whole site stays consistent.

### Leaving a note for the next editor

To explain something in a page without it showing on the website, wrap the note in `{% comment %}` and `{% endcomment %}`:

```
{% comment %} The photos for this page are listed in _data/gis-day-gallery.yml. {% endcomment %}
```

These notes are removed when the site is built, so they never reach the published page. (An HTML comment, `<!-- like this -->`, also hides text, but it is still sent to every visitor and can be seen with "View source", so don't use it for notes.) In the front matter block at the top of a file, start a note line with `#` instead:

```
---
title: Place Lexicon Word
# The card on the Community Geography page
lexicon_word: Place
---
```

### Changing the top menu

Open `_data/nav-top.yml`. Each menu has a `title` (what visitors see) and a `url` (where it goes). Keep the spacing (indentation) and the dashes exactly as they are. Spaces matter in this file.

### Changing the contact email or site title

Open `_config.yml`. Edit the `title`, `description`, or `email` lines. Do not change other lines unless you know what they do.

---

## 5. Add a news story

1. In the Explorer, open `_news/` and then the folder for the current year (for example `_news/2026/`). If the year's folder doesn't exist yet, right-click `_news` and choose **New Folder**.
2. Right-click the year folder and choose **New File**.
3. Name it with lowercase words separated by dashes and ending in `.md`. Example: `new-fellows-announced.md`.
4. Paste this template into the file and fill it in:

```
---
title: New Fellows Announced
published_date: '2026-09-15'
---

Write your story here. Leave a blank line between paragraphs.

You can add a [link](https://example.com), **bold text**, and pictures
(see the "Adding an image" section above).
```

5. Save, then **Commit & Push**.

**Notes**
- `title` is the headline.
- The web address comes from the file name: `new-fellows-announced.md` is published at `/news/new-fellows-announced`. Choose the file name carefully, because renaming the file later changes the address.
- `published_date` is the date in `'YYYY-MM-DD'` form. **Keep the quote marks.**
- If you only know the year, use `published_year: '2026'` instead of `published_date`.
- The news page and the year page update by themselves. You do not need to edit any list. (The first story of a new year needs a year page; see [Section 10](#10-other-things-to-know).)
- **Optional lead picture:** add two lines to the top block: `image: /assets/images/news/my-photo.jpg` and `image_alt: A short description`.
- **Homepage list:** the homepage shows a hand-picked set of stories. To add yours, add `featured_order: 6` (a number nobody else is using). Ask the director before featuring a story. New stories are *not* shown on the homepage automatically.

**Easiest way:** copy an existing news file (for example `_news/2026/michael-devivo-visit.md`), rename the copy, and replace the text. If the file you copied has a `permalink` line, delete it from the copy. Older stories keep a `permalink` so that their addresses from the old website still work.

---

## 6. Add an event

1. Open `_events/` and the folder for the year **the event starts in** (for example `_events/2027/`). Create the folder if needed.
2. Create a new file named like `community-mapping-workshop.md`.
3. Paste and fill in this template:

```
---
title: Community Mapping Workshop
start_date: '2027-03-12'
end_date: '2027-03-12'
start_time: '14:00'
end_time: '16:00'
location: UNM Bandelier East 105
presenter: Jane Doe
---

Describe the event here. Include who it is for, what will happen, and
how to register.
```

4. Save, then **Commit & Push**.

**Notes**
- **Keep the quote marks** around dates and times.
- Use **24-hour time**: 2 p.m. is `'14:00'`, 9 a.m. is `'09:00'`.
- Put the file in the folder matching its start year.
- The web address comes from the file name: `community-mapping-workshop.md` is published at `/events/community-mapping-workshop`.
- If you don't know the time, location, or presenter, **delete that line**. Don't guess.
- **Flyer picture:** upload it to `assets/images/events/` (see Section 4) and add two lines at the top:
  ```
  flyer: /assets/images/events/my-flyer.png
  flyer_alt: Flyer for the Community Mapping Workshop on March 12
  ```
- **Upcoming Events** automatically lists events whose date hasn't passed yet. The list is worked out each time the site is published, so a finished event drops off the next time anyone commits a change.
- Events are never deleted. They stay in the **Events Archive**.

**Easiest way:** copy an existing event (for example `_events/2026/devivo-public-talk.md`), rename the copy, and edit it. Remove lines you don't need (like `permalink`, `heading_id`, `legacy_upcoming`, `date_review`, and `review_notes`).

---

## 7. Add a project

Projects are pages in two folders:

- `pages/projects/current-projects/` for projects happening now
- `pages/projects/past-projects/` for finished projects

A new project is added by creating one file. The cards on the Projects page, and the project page's title, picture, and dates/faculty/partners box, are all built from the information at the top of the file.

1. Upload the project's picture to `assets/images/projects/project/` (see Section 4).
2. Open `pages/projects/current-projects/`, create a new file named like `my-new-project.md`.
3. Paste and fill in this template:

```
---
title: My New Project
thumbnail: /assets/images/projects/project/my-new-project.jpg
start_date: 2027-01-15
end_date: Ongoing
faculty:
  - Dr. Jane Doe
community_member:
  - Example Community Group
summary: Two or three sentences that describe the project. This shows on the project card.
---

Write the full description of the project here.
```

4. Save, then **Commit & Push**.

**Notes**
- `thumbnail` is the project's picture. It appears on the project's card and at the top of its page.
- The web address comes from the file name: `my-new-project.md` is published at `/projects/project/my-new-project`.
- `start_date` is written `YYYY-MM-DD` (no quote marks needed here).
- For a project that hasn't ended, write `end_date: Ongoing`.
- Don't know the faculty or partner? Use `- TBD`.
- The Projects page sorts current projects with the newest start date first.
- Past projects are sorted alphabetically by title.

**Easiest way:** copy a similar project file, rename it, and replace the information.

---

## 8. Move a project from current to past

When a project is finished:

1. Open the project's file in `pages/projects/current-projects/`.
2. Change `end_date: Ongoing` to the real end date, such as `end_date: 2027-05-15`.
3. **Move the file** to the past-projects folder: in the Explorer, **drag the file** from `current-projects` onto the `past-projects` folder (or right-click the file → **Cut**, then right-click `past-projects` → **Paste**).
4. Click **Source Control**, write a message like "Move X project to past projects", and **Commit & Push**.

That's it. The project disappears from the **Projects** page and appears on the **Past Projects** page automatically. The project's web address does not change, so existing links still work. **Do not rename the file**, and if it has a `permalink` line, leave it alone.

To move a project back, drag it back the other way.

---

## 9. Add or edit a person

People appear on the **Our Team** and **Affiliates** pages. Each person is one file in `_people/`.

Template:

```
---
name: Jane Doe
role: Graduate Fellow
affiliation: Department of Geography and Environmental Studies
groups: [team]
display_order: 20
anchor: jane-doe
image: /assets/images/about/jane-doe.jpg
image_alt: Portrait of Jane Doe
---

A short biography goes here.
```

- Use `groups: [team]` for staff or `groups: [affiliates]` for affiliates.
- `display_order` is a number that decides the order on the page. Smaller numbers come first.
- `anchor` must be unique. Use the person's name with dashes.
- The photo is optional. Upload it to `assets/images/about/`.
- To remove someone, delete their file (right-click it → **Delete**).

---

## 10. Other things to know

- **Nothing is live until it is committed and pushed.** The Actions tab shows progress.
- **Check the live site after every change.** Open the page and make sure it looks right.
- **Search updates itself.** New events, news, and people become searchable automatically.
- **Two pages cannot have the same address.** If two files have the same name in the same kind of folder, or the same `permalink`, one silently replaces the other.
- **Never delete the dashes (`---`) that surround the top block** of a page.
- **Do not put passwords or private information** in any file. This repository and website may be public.
- **Photos of people:** get permission before posting.
- **Keep file names simple:** lowercase, dashes instead of spaces, no special characters.
- **Folders starting with `_`, and the `scripts/` and `.github/` folders:** leave them alone unless you know what you're doing. A more technical guide is in `scripts/README.md`.
- **Analytics and UNM footer/header:** these are managed by UNM. Do not edit files inside `_includes/unm/` without checking first.
- **Old pages are kept.** Instead of deleting an old story, event, or project, leave it. Events move to the archive on their own, and projects move to "past."
- **New year?** Create a new year folder in `_news/` and `_events/` (for example `_news/2027/`). Then give the year its news page: copy `pages/news/2026.md`, name the copy `2027.md`, and change every `2026` inside it to `2027`.
- **Backups:** GitHub stores every version of every file. You can look at the history of any file by right-clicking it and choosing **Open Timeline**.
- **Handing over the site?** Add the new editor as a collaborator on the GitHub repository (Settings → Collaborators) and point them to this guide.

## 11. Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| I saved but the website didn't change | You must **Commit & Push** in Source Control. Then wait a few minutes and refresh (Ctrl+F5). |
| The Actions tab shows a red X | Click the failed run, then click **build**. Read the red lines for the file name and message. Fix that file in the browser, then Commit & Push again. The old website stays online meanwhile. |
| Error mentions "Liquid" | Something between `{% %}` or `{{ }}` is mistyped. Compare with a working file. |
| Error mentions "comparison of" | A date is missing its quote marks. Dates must look like `'2027-03-12'` and times like `'14:00'`. |
| Error mentions "front matter" or "YAML" | Something in the top block between the `---` lines is off: a missing colon, a missing dash, or odd spacing. Compare with a working file. |
| My picture doesn't show | Check the file name, the folder, and capital letters. `Photo.JPG` and `photo.jpg` are different. |
| My event isn't in "Upcoming Events" | The date might be in the past, or the file has `date_review: true`. Delete that line. (The list is refreshed each time anyone publishes a change, so a finished event can linger until then.) |
| My text looks like one big paragraph | Add a blank line between paragraphs. |
| I can't push my changes | You may not have permission. Ask the website owner to add you as a collaborator. |
| Nothing works | Stop, don't delete anything, and ask for help. All past versions can be restored. |
